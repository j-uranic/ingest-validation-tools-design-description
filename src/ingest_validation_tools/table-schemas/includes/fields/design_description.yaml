  description: |
    In 25-250 words describe the sequencing process. The design_description should describe both the library construction process and materials, and be sure to note any important or unique information about how the sequencing library was constructed or analyzed. Include part numbers for any kits used and assume the users of your data are informed in the field but know nothing about your work other than the metadata provided. Citations for protocols.io pages and journal articles can be included in the design description as additional resources but do not replace a text description. 
    **Example design_description:** \“We used SeqCap EZHuman Exome Library v3.0 as capture probes. Libraries were prepared according to Roche-NimbleGen’s instructions. 1ug of DNA was fragmented, end-repaired, dA-tailed, and ligated Illumina’s TruSeq adapters. After adapter ligation, DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers. Then, the purified libraries were captured with SeqCap probes following the Roche-NimbleGen’s instructions. The captured products were further amplified and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system following the manufacturer’s protocols.\”
